# Custom React Native Snippets

This repository contains few of the snippets that i use in my react native videos on my youtube channel.


## Setup Instructions (VSCODE)

- Open Visual Studio Code

- CODE > PREFERENCES > USER SNIPPETS > **javascriptreact.json/jsx-attr.json**

- Copy the code from this repository into that file.


## Issues :

- In case your javascriptreact.json snippets don't work, try and copy it into :

- CODE > PREFERENCES > USER SNIPPETS > **javascript.json**

## javascript.json/javascriptreact.json Snippets 
```sh
imrnc  - Import React Native Component
